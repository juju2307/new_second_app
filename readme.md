# Second_App(Pet_App)
--------------------

We'll build a very simple pet management app. With no UI other than the API endpoints we'll design in a RESTfull manner and the data stored remotely through mongoose objects on mlab, a MONGODB BAAS (Backend As A Service). At multiple steps we'll be making use of postman, our favorite API development environment. The example folder is the app in it's finished state with commented code.
